          <p>Tesla organized its very first ‚ÄúAutonomy Day‚Äù on April 22, 2019. They displayed and explained their new technologies which are created for FSD (Full Self-Driving) system. They want to make this event annually to introduce the improvements in FSD.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Tesla‚Äôs Brand New Computer</h2>

          <p> The first presenter was Pete Bannon. He is an important figure who developed chips for Apple before joining Tesla in 2016. He is the director of Tesla‚Äôs FSD hardware. They introduced that Tesla produces its own computer to put on their cars. Goodbye to Nvidia! üëã</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted"><a href="https://electrek.co/2019/04/22/tesla-full-self-driving-computer-details/screen-shot-2019-04-22-at-2-48-22-pm/">Click here</a> for photo credit.</span>

          <p> He and Elon introduced the computer as the best chip for self-driving cars. The chip is particularly developed to succeed with neural networks. We see that Tesla uses a similar technology with Google on their AI hardware. Google introduced TPUs in 2016. Tensor Processing Unit is an AI accelerator that makes the matrix operations literally on the silicon. That made the AI training and inference faster for them. Tesla‚Äôs new computer also has a neural network processor which is a special part of hardware designed to make matrix, activation and pooling operations faster. Actually, this strategy is better for Tesla because they only have one aim: Autonomous Driving. They don‚Äôt need to design the chips for anything else. No LSTMs, no GANs, also no training. Elon said that they have a supercomputer to do the training part.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">The Power of Real World Data</h2>

          <p>There are other companies who work on self-driving cars. Waymo and the others advocate that they can simulate billions of miles of driving data. No. They can‚Äôt. The real world is messy. It is impossible to simulate all situations that you can see in the real world. Tesla has a better strategy. It has the fleet. Tesla has more cars that collect data on the road more than everyone combined. This is a huge opportunity for them.</p>

          <p>They showed that their whole FSD software is based on deep learning. Of course, they have a lot of pieces of software which are not deep learning applications but the best approach for vision is deep learning in today‚Äôs world. They have everything to develop deep learning applications. They have (really big) big data. They have videos of millions of miles of driving data. They have powerful computers both for training and inference. They have a lot of great AI developers.</p>
          
          <h2 class="section-heading">Robotaxis</h2>

          <p>The first information about the robotaxi idea was Elon Musk's tweet.</p>

          <p>And now, they told that people will be using their cars as robotaxies. Your car will go and earn money while you are sleeping. Can this be real? We don't know. We know that some companies want to be "Autonomous Uber". Tesla joined to this group.</p>
          
          <p>In conclusion, Tesla showed that autonomous driving is a reality of our life today. We waited for this ‚Äúfuture‚Äù for a long time. Tesla, Waymo, Nvidia and a lot of companies which I don‚Äôt know the names are working on self-driving cars today. We will have autonomous cars everywhere soon.</p>
